# Milk Selection Game

An interactive game where you choose between two glasses of milk, each associated with a different mammal.

**Note:** I did not create or design this concept. This is a recreation/implementation of an existing idea.

## How to Play

1. Two images of milk glasses are displayed
2. Each glass has a random animal name beneath it
3. Click on one of the images to make your selection
4. New random animal words will appear for the next round
5. View cumulative statistics by clicking "See what everyone else thinks"

## Features

- Random animal word generation
